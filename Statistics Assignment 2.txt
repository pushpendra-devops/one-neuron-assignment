1. How can we figure out what the interquartile range is?
Answer : 
IQR = Q3-Q1
IQR : Interquartile Range
Q3 : Upper Quartile
Q1 : Lower Quartile 


2. What exactly is the value of the 5-number theory
Ans: 5 number summary has following 5 parameters:
i) Minimum Value in distribution
ii) Q1 : First quartile
iii) Q2 = Second Quartile : Median
iv) Q3 : Thired quartile
v) Max. Value


3. What is the relationship between standard deviation and variance?
Ans: Standard Deviation  = sqrt(Variance)



4. What does the difference between variance and standard deviation mean?
Variance and Standard deviation both provide dispersion of data.

Standard Deviation  = sqrt(Variance)

Standard deviation provide magnitude of dispertion from mean.



5. When is it appropriate to refer to a skewed data distribution?
Ans:
When data points are clustered more toward one side of the scale than the other then data distribution is skewed.
In skewed data mean, median and mode are not close enough.
