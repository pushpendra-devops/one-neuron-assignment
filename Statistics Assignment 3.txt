1. Write the Gaussian Distribution empirical formula.
Ans: If a distribution follows a normal distribution than :
(μ - σ ) <= x <= (μ + σ ) ~	68% Data 
(μ - 2σ ) <= x <= (μ + 2σ ) ~	95% Data
(μ - 3σ ) <= x <= (μ + 3σ ) ~	99.7% Data

Where μ : Mean , σ : Standard Deviation


2. What is the Z-score, and why is it important?
The Z score is the number of standard deviations by which the value of 
a raw score is above or below the mean value of what is being observed or measured.
(a) Allows us to calculate the probability of a score occurring within our normal distribution
(b) Enables us to compare two scores that are from different normal distributions.


3. What is an outlier, exactly?
Answer: An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample from a population.



4. What are our options for dealing with outliers in our dataset?
Ans: We can use scatter plot or Box plot to visualize outliers in our dataset.
Apart from visualization we can use IQR or Standard Deviation to find outliers.
IQR method :Any data outside ==> [Q1-1.5IQR, Q3+1.5IQR] is considered as outliers
Standard Deviation method ==> [Mean-3SD, Mean+3SD] 
                                   
We can do following to deal with outliers:
i) Change the value of outliers
ii) Remove Outliers

5. Write the sample and population variances equations and explain Bessel Correction


sample variance = [∑(xi−μ)2] / n-1
sample standard deviation = sqrt ([∑(xi−μ)2] / n-1)


Bessel Correction :This correction is made to correct for the fact that these sample statistics tend to underestimate the actual 
parameters found in the population.
The calculations for both the sample standard deviation and the sample variance both contain a little bias. Bessel’s correction 
(i.e. subtracting 1 from your sample size) corrects this bias. 
In other words, we usually get a more accurate answer if we use n-1 instead of n.
