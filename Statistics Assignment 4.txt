1. What is the definition of covariance? Create the formula for it.
Ans: Cov(X,Y) = Σ(Xi – μ1) (Yi – μ2) / N

Covariance is a measure of joint variability of two variable.
It tells us, how much two variables change together.


2. What makes Correlations better than Covariance?
Answer : Covariance value could be anything between - infinity to + infinity while 
correlation gives value in range of -1 to +1.
Clearly we can not only describe the direction but also the strength of variability.


3. Describe the Central Limit Theorem
Answer :The distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger.

4. What are the advantages of Spearman Correlation over Pearson Correlation?
Ans: Pearson correlation coefficients measure the linear relationship between the variables while 
Spearman correlation coefficients measure only monotonic relationships, relationship in which the variables tend 
to move in the same/opposite direction but not necessarily at a constant rate whereas the rate is constant in a linear relationship.
